Given {}, achieve {'cart': 1, 'rail': 28, 'iron_pickaxe': 1} [time <= 300]

Running Complex Test Case
Initial: {}
Goal: {'cart': 1, 'rail': 28, 'iron_pickaxe': 1}
--------------------------------------------------
Solution found: True
Plan length: 87

Task Description:
Th complex case extends beyond the original test cases by requiring the creation of significantly more rails (28 vs. 20) while also needing to craft an iron pickaxe.

Resource Challenges:
- Gather and process large amounts of iron ore
- Requires extensive coal mining for smelting

Tool Progression:
- Wooden tools for initial gathering
- Stone tools for faster resource collection
- Iron pickaxe crafting as final goal

Solution:
- Found valid solution with 87 steps
- Recipe time cost: 300 time units
- Real-world execution time: ~5 seconds
